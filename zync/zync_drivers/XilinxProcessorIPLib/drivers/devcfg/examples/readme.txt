/** \page example Examples
You can refer to the below stated example applications for more details on how to use devcfg driver.

@section ex1 xdevcfg_selftest_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XDevcfg driver directly.
This example performs the basic selftest using the devcfg driver.

For details, see xdevcfg_selftest_example.c.

@section ex2 xdevcfg_interrupt_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XDevcfg driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver in interrupt mode
and downloads bitstream to the FPGA fabric.

For details, see xdevcfg_interrupt_example.c.

@section ex3 xdevcfg_polled_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XDevcfg driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver in polled mode
and downloads bitstream to the FPGA fabric.

For details, see xdevcfg_polled_example.c.

@section ex4 xdevcfg_reg_readback_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XDevcfg driver directly.
This example prints out the values of all the configuration registers
in the FPGA.

For details, see xdevcfg_reg_readback_example.c.
