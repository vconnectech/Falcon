/** \page example Examples
You can refer to the below stated example applications for more details on how to use srio driver.

@section ex1 xsrio_dma_loopback_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XSrio driver directly.
This example demonstrates how to use xsrio driver on the Xilinx SRIO Gen2 Core.
The SRIO Gen2 comprised of phy, logical and transport and buffer layers.
Using this IP We can generate both messaging and read/write semantics.
Inorder to test this example external loopback is required at the boardlevel
Between the SRIO Tx and Rx pins.
