1. INTRODUCTION
------------

This example application is built to demonstrate the functionality of Xilinx HDMI Transmitter only.

For details, see xhdmi_example.c.


2. FEATURES
------------
* A test pattern generator IP will generate video stream according to user selection (via UART), then HDMI TX will transmit HDMI stream to the downstream SINK.
* If the HDCP (1.4, 2.2 or both) is enabled by the hardware, the application will supports HDCP handling in HDMI TX.

For details, please refer to PG235 and PG230.
