/** \page example Examples
You can refer to the below stated example applications for more details on how to use sysmonpsu driver.

@section ex1 xsysmonpsu_intr_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XSysmonpsu driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver in interrupt mode to
handle on-chip temperature and voltage alarm interrupts.

For details, see xsysmonpsu_intr_example.c.

@section ex2 xsysmonpsu_low_level_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XSysmonpsu driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the low level driver to check
the on-chip temperature and voltages.

For details, see xsysmonpsu_low_level_example.c.

@section ex3 xsysmonpsu_polled_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XSysmonpsu driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver in polled mode to check
the on-chip temperature and voltages.

For details, see xsysmonpsu_polled_example.c.

@section ex4 xsysmonpsu_single_ch_intr_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XSysmonpsu driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the driver in single channel
interrupt mode to handle End of Conversion(EOC) and VCCINT alarm
interrupts.

For details, see xsysmonpsu_single_ch_intr_example.c.
